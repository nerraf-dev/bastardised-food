            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Bastardised Food is run by a person who enjoys tasty food and different flavours and styles. This is a place to share some of the random creations I've made. The whole thing is pretty new and was put together to encourage me to cook more. I find that trying new dishes and making (hopefully) tasty things really does positive things for my mental health, which right now needs the help.</p>
